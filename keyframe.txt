Define Functions:

extract_features: This function takes an image and a ResNet-50 model as input, preprocesses the image, passes it through the model, and returns the flattened feature vector extracted from the last fully connected layer of the ResNet-50 model.
apply_pca: Applies PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the extracted features to reduce their dimensionality.
perform_clustering: Performs K-means clustering on the reduced feature matrix.
select_keyframes: Selects keyframes based on a certain criterion from the cluster labels.
summarize_video: Generates a video summary using the selected keyframes. It reads the input video frame by frame, writes the selected keyframes to an output video file, and returns the summary frames.
main: The main function that orchestrates the video summarization process. It loads the ResNet-50 model with pretrained weights, extracts features from each frame of the input video using the ResNet-50 model, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering to group similar features, selects keyframes based on the clustering results, and generates a video summary using those keyframes.
Main Execution:

The main function is called with the path to the input video file (video_path).
Within the main function:
The ResNet-50 model with pretrained weights is loaded.
Features are extracted from each frame of the input video using the ResNet-50 model.
PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction.
K-means clustering is performed to group similar features.
Keyframes are selected based on the clustering results.
A video summary is generated using the selected keyframes.
The generated video summary is returned and stored in the summary variable.
Example Usage:

An example usage of the main function is provided with the path to a sample video file ('./test.mp4').
The main function is called with this video path, and the generated video summary is stored in the summary variable.
Output:

The summary variable contains the frames selected for the video summary.
These frames can be further processed or analyzed as needed.
