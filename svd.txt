Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three matrices: U, Î£, and V^T. In the context of image processing, you can use SVD to reduce the dimensionality of image data while preserving important information. Here's a basic outline of how you might use SVD for feature extraction:

Convert each image into a matrix representation (e.g., flatten the pixel values into a vector).
Stack these vectors to form a data matrix.
Perform SVD on the data matrix.
Select the most significant components (e.g., based on the magnitude of singular values) to represent each image.
These selected components can serve as features for subsequent tasks.
Connective Clustering: Connective clustering, also known as hierarchical clustering, is a technique used to group similar data points into clusters. Unlike partitioning-based clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means), hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters. Here's how you might use connective clustering for feature extraction:

Define a distance metric between pairs of data points (e.g., Euclidean distance between SVD-transformed feature vectors).
Use hierarchical clustering algorithms like agglomerative clustering to group similar feature vectors together.
Determine the appropriate number of clusters or cluster hierarchy based on domain knowledge or by analyzing clustering metrics (e.g., silhouette score).
Assign each image to one or more clusters based on its feature vector representation.
